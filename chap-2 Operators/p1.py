Here are some **Python operator-related questions** for preparation:  

### **1. Arithmetic Operators**  
1. What will be the output of `10 + 5 * 2`?  
2. What is the result of `7 % 3`?  
3. How does Python handle division with `/` vs. `//`?  
4. Write a program to swap two numbers using arithmetic operators.  
5. What is the output of `2 ** 3 ** 2`?
