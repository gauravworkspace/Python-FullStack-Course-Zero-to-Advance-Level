# 1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.  

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i)

# Using while loop
# num = 0
# while num<10:
#     num = num+1
#     print(num)

# 3. Print even numbers from 1 to 50.  

# for i in range(1,51):
#     if(i%2==0):
#         print(i)

# 4. Print odd numbers from 1 to 50.  

# for i in range(1,51):
#     if(i%2!=0):
#         print(i)

# 5. Print numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.  

# for i in range(10,0,-1):
#     print(i)

# 6. Print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.  
# sum_num=0
# for i in range(1,101):
#     sum_num = sum_num + i
# print(sum_num)

# 7. Print the product of numbers from 1 to 10.  
# product = 1
# for i in range(1,11):
#     product *=i
# print(product)

# 8. Print the multiplication table of a given number.  

# number = 4
# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(number*i)

# 9. Print all numbers divisible by 5 between 1 and 100.  

# for number in range(1,101):
#     if(number % 5 == 0):
#         print(number)

# 10. Print the factorial of a given number using a loop.  

# number = 5
# fact = 1
